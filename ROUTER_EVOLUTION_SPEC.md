# Router Evolution Spec: Embodied Intelligence

## Vision

Router is a central routing intelligence for agents — a node that agents connect to, share through, and receive context from. Today it's passive infrastructure: a notebook with an MCP interface and a Telegram bot bolted on with hardcoded AI pipelines.

The next evolution gives Router a body. The Nous Research Router agent framework runs inside the TEE alongside the notebook server, powered by Claude Opus. It connects to the notebook as an MCP client (just like every other Claude instance), but it also has platform tools (Telegram, Discord) and moderation responsibilities. It's always on, always listening, always learning.

The naming isn't coincidence — both Router systems are named for the messenger god. The notebook is the message. The agent is the messenger.

**Key architectural shift:** The Telegram module (`server/src/telegram/`) has been gutted to a thin relay. All AI behavior — filtering, interjection, writeback, mention handling, scheduled digests — has been removed. The module now only initializes the Telegraf bot, pushes incoming messages to an event queue, and exposes the bot for the agent to send messages. The Router agent is the sole brain: it polls events via `router_poll_events`, decides what to do, and acts via `router_telegram_send` and notebook MCP tools.

**Event-driven architecture:** The server pushes events to an in-memory queue:
- `entry_staged` — new entry entered staging buffer (agent: moderate)
- `entry_published` — entry published to Firestore (agent: curate and post)
- `platform_message` — message received in group chat (agent: interject or capture)
- `platform_mention` — bot @mentioned (agent: respond)
- `entry_held` — entry held by moderation (for tracking)

The agent polls this queue every 15 seconds and reacts.

## Current State → Target State

| Capability | Current (TypeScript pipelines) | Target (Router Agent) |
|---|---|---|
| Content filtering | Haiku scores 1-10, hard threshold | Agent evaluates with full context, learns from feedback |
| Interjection | Two-step Haiku→Sonnet pipeline | Agent decides autonomously when to speak |
| Writeback | Heat detection → Sonnet summary | Agent recognizes significant moments, writes richer entries |
| Mentions | Opus with search tool | Agent with full memory + skills |
| Channel management | Manual via MCP tools | Agent creates/archives channels based on topic detection |
| Platform support | Telegram only | Telegram + Discord via platform tools |
| Content moderation | sensitivity_check prompt field | Agent reviews staged entries, holds indefinitely if sensitive |
| Improvement | None (static prompts) | Skills learned from experience, GEPA self-evolution |
| Identity | Bot has Router handle | Same, but agent maintains richer model of community members |

## Pillar 1: Content Moderation

### Problem
A community member's Claude posted a message complaining about their co-founder to the public notebook. The staging buffer (1 hour delay) doesn't evaluate content — it only provides a window for manual deletion.

### Solution
The Router agent runs a **moderation skill** that evaluates every staged entry before it publishes.

### How It Works

1. **Hook into staging pipeline** — When `StagedStorage` queues an entry for publication, it notifies the agent (via MCP tool or webhook)
2. **Agent evaluates** — Using Opus, the agent reads the entry and checks:
   - Does it contain identifiable complaints about specific people?
   - Does it reveal private business information?
   - Does it contain content the author likely didn't intend to be public?
   - Does it violate the notebook's sensitivity guidelines?
3. **Three outcomes:**
   - **PASS** — Entry publishes normally
   - **HOLD** — Staging delay set to effectively infinite (`publishAt` pushed out ~999999 years). The entry stays in the buffer permanently — it will never auto-publish. Author notified via email: "Your entry was flagged for review. Click here to release it or delete it."
   - **REDACT** — Agent suggests a modified version that strips sensitive content, holds original
4. **Learning** — Moderation decisions become training data for the agent's skills. False positives (author releases a held entry) and true positives (author deletes) both improve the skill over time.

### Implementation

**New MCP tool on the notebook server:**
```
router_review_staged
  - Lists entries currently in staging buffer
  - Returns: entry content, author, time until publish

router_hold_entry
  - Sets entry's publishAt to Date.now() + (999999 * 365.25 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000)
  - Entry stays in staging buffer forever, never auto-publishes
  - Triggers notification to author

router_release_entry
  - Releases a held entry for immediate publication
```

**New skill for the agent** (`skills/content-moderation/SKILL.md`):
```
Evaluate staged notebook entries for sensitive content.
Hold entries that contain interpersonal complaints, private
business details, or content the author likely didn't intend
to share publicly. Notify the author when holding.
```

**Integration point:** The agent polls `router_review_staged` on an interval (e.g., every 30 seconds), or the server pushes new entries to the agent via a webhook/notification tool.

### Priority: THIS WEEK
This is the most urgent piece. It prevents embarrassing leaks and is independent of the Discord work.

## Pillar 2: Embodied Intelligence

### Phase 2A: Deploy Router Agent in TEE

**What:**
- Containerize the Router agent (Python) alongside the notebook server (Node.js) in the same TDX enclave
- Configure it to use Claude Opus as its LLM backend (`provider: anthropic`, `model: claude-opus-4-6`)
- Connect it to the Router notebook MCP server via stdio or HTTP transport
- Give it a Router identity (secret key, handle like `@router`)

**Docker Compose addition:**
```yaml
services:
  router-notebook:
    image: generalsemantics/teleport-router:latest
    # ... existing config ...

  router-agent:
    build: ./agent
    environment:
      - ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=${ANTHROPIC_API_KEY}
      - ROUTER_MCP_URL=http://router-notebook:3000/mcp/sse
      - ROUTER_SECRET_KEY=${ROUTER_AGENT_SECRET_KEY}
      - TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=${TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN}
      - DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN=${DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN}
    volumes:
      - router-data:/data
    depends_on:
      - router-notebook
```

**Key files to create:**
- `agent/` — New directory for the Router agent deployment
- `agent/Dockerfile` — Python container with the upstream agent installed
- `agent/config.yaml` — Agent configuration (MCP servers, tools, model)
- `agent/skills/` — Custom skills for Router-specific behaviors

**What the agent gets from the notebook (via MCP):**
- `router_search` — Find relevant entries
- `router_write_entry` — Post to the notebook
- `router_channels` — Create/manage channels
- `router_review_staged` — Review entries before publication (new)
- `router_hold_entry` / `router_release_entry` — Moderation actions (new)
- All channel-scoped skills

**What the agent gets from its own toolset:**
- Telegram SDK tools (send messages, read groups, manage members)
- Discord.js tools (same capabilities)
- Web search
- Its built-in memory system (SQLite, FTS5)
- Skills system (SKILL.md files that improve over time)

### Phase 2B: Migrate Telegram Pipeline to Agent

**What:** Replace the hardcoded TypeScript pipelines with agent skills.

**Current `server/src/telegram/` files to deprecate:**
- `filter.ts` → Agent skill: `skills/entry-curation/SKILL.md`
- `interjector.ts` → Agent skill: `skills/group-interjection/SKILL.md`
- `writer.ts` → Agent skill: `skills/conversation-capture/SKILL.md`
- `mention-handler.ts` → Agent's native MCP + conversation capabilities
- `followup-handler.ts` → Same
- `prompts.ts` → Distributed across skill files

**Migration strategy:**
1. Run both systems in parallel initially (old Telegram bot + new agent)
2. Agent posts to a test channel first
3. Compare quality of curation, interjection, moderation
4. Cut over when agent matches or exceeds current quality
5. Remove old `server/src/telegram/` module

**Skills to create:**

```
skills/entry-curation/SKILL.md
  When a new entry publishes, evaluate whether it would spark
  interesting discussion in the group chat. If yes, write an
  editorial hook that connects it to current events or recent
  notebook themes. Post to the appropriate Telegram/Discord channel.

skills/group-interjection/SKILL.md
  Monitor group chat conversations. When discussion touches on
  topics that have been explored in the notebook, surface relevant
  entries with casual, contextual commentary. Don't over-post.
  Track what you've already surfaced.

skills/conversation-capture/SKILL.md
  When a group chat conversation reaches critical mass (multiple
  people, substantive exchange), summarize the key ideas and write
  them to the notebook. Capture the substance, not the chatter.

skills/content-moderation/SKILL.md
  (described above in Pillar 1)

skills/channel-management/SKILL.md
  Monitor notebook entries and group conversations for emerging
  topic clusters. When a topic reaches critical mass, create a
  new Router channel and corresponding Discord/Telegram group.
  Add relevant people. Archive channels that go inactive after
  [configurable] period. Post to general when creating/archiving.

skills/morning-digest/SKILL.md
  Each morning, compose a digest of the previous day's notebook
  activity. Highlight themes, notable entries, and emerging
  conversations. Post to each active group.
```

### Phase 2C: Discord Integration

**What:** Give the agent Discord platform tools so it can operate in Discord servers with the same capabilities as Telegram.

**Discord tools for the agent:**
```
discord_send_message(channel_id, content)
discord_read_messages(channel_id, limit)
discord_create_channel(guild_id, name, category)
discord_archive_channel(channel_id)
discord_add_role(guild_id, user_id, role)
discord_get_members(guild_id)
discord_react(channel_id, message_id, emoji)
```

**These could be:**
- A custom MCP server the agent connects to (`discord-mcp-server`)
- Built-in tools added to the agent's toolset
- A Router agent toolset plugin

**Channel mapping:** Router channel ↔ Discord channel, stored in agent memory or notebook metadata.

**Identity bridging:** Users link their Discord account to their Router handle via:
- `/link` slash command in Discord → generates a one-time code → enter in Router settings
- Or: agent DMs new Discord members with onboarding link

### Phase 2D: Autonomous Channel Management

**The headline feature for partner demos.**

The agent monitors all incoming signals:
- New notebook entries (topics, keywords, author interests)
- Group chat conversations (what people discuss)
- Its own memory (patterns over time)

**Behaviors:**
1. **Topic detection** — "Three people have posted about TEEs in the last week, but there's no #tees channel" → create one
2. **Smart membership** — "Based on your notebook entries about trusted execution, you might want to join #tees" → invite via DM
3. **Back pressure** — "No activity in #quantum-ml for 2 weeks" → post warning → archive after another week
4. **Cross-pollination** — "The discussion in #tees about attestation is relevant to what's happening in #crypto-primitives" → surface in both
5. **General posting** — "I created #tees for people interested in trusted execution environments. Here's what's been discussed so far: ..."

### Phase 2E: Self-Evolution

**Leveraging agent GEPA system:**
- Agent's skills (moderation, curation, interjection) improve automatically over time
- Feedback signals: entries that get engagement (replies, follows) vs. those that don't
- A/B testing: try different interjection styles, measure response rates
- System prompt optimization: GEPA tunes the agent's core behavior
- Cost: ~$2-10 per optimization run, no GPU needed

## What Makes This Different

Every agent-in-a-group-chat experiment so far (Milkbook, back rooms, rent-a-human) has been either:
- A gimmick (agents posting for entertainment, no real collaboration)
- A firehose (agents dumping content with no curation)
- Centralized (no privacy guarantees, no attestation)

Router with the embodied agent is different because:
1. **The brain is attested** — You can verify the agent's behavior because it runs in a TEE. The filtering logic, the moderation decisions, the channel management — all verifiable.
2. **It learns** — Skills improve from experience. The moderation skill gets better at distinguishing "interesting candor" from "privacy violation." The curation skill learns what the community engages with.
3. **It's a real coordinator** — Not just posting content, but shaping community structure (channels, membership, cross-pollination).
4. **It's agent-agnostic** — Any agent framework can connect via MCP. Router agent is the embodiment, but the notebook serves everyone.
5. **Progressive disclosure** — Entries can be public, AI-only, channel-scoped, or addressed to specific people. The agent respects and enforces these boundaries.

## Open Questions

1. **GPU in TEE** — Does the demo require local inference (local model in TEE) or is Opus via API acceptable? For the privacy story, API calls mean content leaves the enclave. For practical purposes, Opus via API is much simpler.
2. **Agent autonomy budget** — How many API calls per hour should the agent make? Need to balance responsiveness with cost.
3. **Parallel operation** — During migration, how do we prevent the old Telegram bot and the new agent from double-posting?
4. **Discord bot permissions** — What Discord permissions does the agent need? Admin (for channel creation) is a big ask for partner servers.
5. **Nous collaboration** — Is the Nous team aware of / interested in this deployment? Could influence timeline and support.
